# Virtual Assistant Repository

This repository contains the source code and assets for creating a basic virtual assistant in Python. The virtual assistant can perform various tasks such as responding to voice commands, fetching information, and interacting with basic applications.

## Directory Structure

- **Python Script**
  - `main.py`: The main script for running the virtual assistant.

- **Assets**
  - `icon.ico`: Icon file used for the virtual assistant application.
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore when using Git version control.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the virtual assistant.

## Detailed Overview

### Python Script

1. **main.py**: This script contains the core logic for the virtual assistant. It includes functionality to take voice input, process commands, and provide appropriate responses or actions. The virtual assistant may utilize libraries for text-to-speech, speech recognition, and API integrations to execute commands.

### Assets

1. **icon.ico**: An icon file used for branding the virtual assistant application, especially useful when creating an executable version of the assistant.

2. **.gitignore**: A configuration file used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This is helpful to avoid tracking unnecessary files, such as temporary files and virtual environments.

3. **requirements.txt**: A text file listing all the required Python libraries that need to be installed to run the virtual assistant. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Command to Create Executable

To create an executable file for the virtual assistant, use the following command:

```sh
pyinstaller -F -w -i icon.ico main.py
```

## Getting Started

To run the virtual assistant, make sure you have Python installed and have installed all the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Then, run the main script using the command:

```sh
python main.py
```

Ensure that you have a microphone connected and configured properly to use the voice commands effectively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries are specified in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip`.
